# PacMen-Exercise
This exercise allows you to add as many pacmen to your screen as you want and then once you click start the pacmen move around the screen bouncing off the walls and one another.

How to Run: Click the add pacmen button to add as many pacmen as you would like, then click start to move the pacmen around the screen. To move the pacmen faster click the start button again.

Roadmap of Future Improvements: Next new functionality will be added to allow for you to change the size and color of your pacment and place ghosts on the screen as well. For these, functionality will also be added so you can use your mouse to move these objects on your screen. Also, additional functionality will be added to stop/restart the game so you do not have to just reload everytime.
